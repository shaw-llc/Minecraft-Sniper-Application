## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minecraft-sniper.git
cd minecraft-sniper
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. (Optional) Set up a file with proxies (one per line) if you want to use proxy rotation:
```
http://user:pass@host:port
http://host:port
```

## üìã Usage

The tool provides two interfaces: a simple command-line interface for basic use and an advanced interface with more features.

### Basic Usage

To check if a username is available:

```bash
python minecraft_sniper.py check username
```

To monitor a username until it becomes available:

```bash
python minecraft_sniper.py monitor username
```

To snipe a username at a specific time:

```bash
python minecraft_sniper.py snipe username -t "2023-08-15 14:30:00" -s distributed
```

### Advanced Usage

The advanced version includes more features and options:

```bash
python advanced_sniper.py check -f usernames.txt --save results.json
```

```bash
python advanced_sniper.py snipe -u coolname -s adaptive -a
```

### Command Line Arguments

#### Basic Sniper (`minecraft_sniper.py`)

```
Commands:
  check     Check if a username is available
  monitor   Monitor a username until it becomes available
  snipe     Snipe a username at the specified time
  status    Check account status and eligibility
  test      Test network latency and other functions

Global options:
  -a, --auth          Use authentication (requires browser login or .env file)
  -v, --verbose       Enable verbose output for debugging
```

#### Advanced Sniper (`advanced_sniper.py`)

```
Commands:
  check     Check username availability
  monitor   Monitor usernames until they become available
  snipe     Snipe usernames at specific times
  upcoming  Check for upcoming available usernames
  test      Test network latency and other functions
  status    Check account status and eligibility

Global options:
  -a, --auth          Use authentication (required for claiming and sniping)
  --threads THREADS   Maximum number of concurrent threads (default: 5)
  -v, --verbose       Enable verbose output for debugging
```

### Authentication

The tool uses Microsoft's OAuth flow for authentication. When you run a command with the `-a` flag, it will:

1. Open a browser window for you to log in with your Microsoft account
2. Wait for successful authentication
3. Store the tokens securely for future use

You can also create a `.env` file in the same directory with the following content (though browser auth is more secure):

```
EMAIL=your_microsoft_email@example.com
PASSWORD=your_microsoft_password
```

### Configuring Notifications

To set up notifications, you can configure the notification channels in the tool:

#### Discord Notifications

Run the following command to set up Discord notifications:

```bash
python notifications.py configure discord "your_webhook_url"
```

#### Email Notifications

```bash
python notifications.py configure email "smtp.gmail.com" 587 "your_email@gmail.com" "password" "from@gmail.com" "to@gmail.com"
```

#### Testing Notifications

```bash
python notifications.py test
```

## üß† Sniping Strategies

### Timing Strategy
Best for: Names with known drop times where precision is key
- Makes pre-emptive checks before the target time
- Increases check frequency as the target time approaches
- Adjusts claim attempts based on availability detection

### Burst Strategy
Best for: Quick claims when a name is just found to be available
- Sends a rapid burst of claim requests
- Low delay between attempts
- Simple but effective for immediate availability

### Distributed Strategy
Best for: High-competition usernames
- Uses multiple threads to maximize chances
- Distributes requests across multiple workers
- Coordinates between threads to avoid conflicts

### Precision Strategy
Best for: Names with exact drop times where milliseconds matter
- Compensates for network latency
- Uses adaptive timing windows
- Adjusts behavior based on availability status

### Adaptive Strategy
Best for: When you're not sure which strategy will work best
- Analyzes historical successes
- Adapts based on time of day and username characteristics
- Learns from past attempts and improves over time

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Proxy Configuration

To use proxies:

```bash
python advanced_sniper.py -a --load-proxies proxies.txt
```

Or set them programmatically:

```python
sniper = Sniper()
sniper.load_proxies_from_file("proxies.txt")
sniper.test_proxies()  # Test and filter out bad proxies
```

### Customizing Strategies

You can customize the parameters for each strategy:

```python
from sniper import Sniper, BurstStrategy

# Create a customized burst strategy
custom_burst = BurstStrategy(burst_count=15, burst_delay=0.05)

sniper = Sniper()
sniper.strategies["custom"] = custom_burst
sniper.authenticate()
sniper.snipe_username("coolname", "custom")
```

## üìä Statistics and Analytics

The tool keeps track of your sniping attempts and success rates. You can view your statistics by running:

```bash
python advanced_sniper.py stats
```

This will show you:
- Overall success rate
- Best-performing strategy
- Recent successful claims
- Average response times
- Rate limit occurrences

## üîç How It Works

1. **Authentication**: The tool authenticates with Microsoft using the OAuth flow
2. **Drop Time Detection**: It checks NameMC to estimate when a username will become available
3. **Availability Checking**: It periodically checks the Mojang API for username availability
4. **Strategy Selection**: It selects the best strategy based on the target username and timing
5. **Adaptive Execution**: It executes the strategy with precise timing and adapts to API responses
6. **Claim Attempt**: When the username becomes available, it attempts to claim it immediately
7. **Result Analysis**: It analyzes the results to improve future attempts

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

- The main API endpoint used is `https://api.mojang.com/users/profiles/minecraft/<username>`
- A 204 status code means the username is available
- A 200 status code means the username is taken
- A 429 status code means you're being rate limited and should back off
- Username changes are performed via `https://api.minecraftservices.com/minecraft/profile/name/<username>`
- The tool uses a custom User-Agent and respects rate limits to avoid bans

## üìù Future Improvements

- GUI interface for easier use
- More advanced proxy rotation and management
- Machine learning for optimal strategy selection
- Integration with more notification services
- Support for automatic batch operations
- Detection of rare/valuable usernames
- Support for cross-platform desktop notifications

## ‚≠ê Tips for Successful Sniping

1. **Test Your Connection**: Use the latency test feature to understand your network characteristics
2. **Use Proxies**: Distribute requests across multiple IPs to avoid rate limits
3. **Target Specific Times**: Focus on known drop times rather than continuous monitoring
4. **Choose the Right Strategy**: Use the adaptive strategy if you're unsure, or select a specific strategy based on the username type
5. **Be Patient**: Username sniping is competitive, and success often requires multiple attempts
6. **Monitor Stats**: Check your statistics to see which strategies work best for you
