## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This tool is provided for educational purposes only. Please be aware that:

- Using automated tools to interact with Mojang's API may violate their Terms of Service
- Excessive use can lead to IP bans or account suspensions
- We do not encourage or support any violation of Mojang's Terms of Service
- Use at your own risk

## üì¢ Latest Updates (2023)

**Important API Information**: According to current research, Mojang's API enforces a rate limit of approximately 60 requests per minute. Our tool intelligently manages these limits to avoid temporary blocks while maximizing effectiveness.

**Key Improvements**:
- Smart rate limiting system that respects Mojang's 60 requests/minute constraint
- Optimized batch processing of username availability checks
- Enhanced proxy support for distributed requests
- Improved error handling and recovery from rate limiting

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical Considerations

Based on the latest research about Minecraft username sniping, it's important to understand:

1. **Terms of Service**: Using automated tools to interact with Mojang's API may violate their EULA, especially for commercial purposes.

2. **Personal Use**: While personal, non-commercial use exists in a gray area, you should be aware of the potential risks:
   - Account suspension or ban
   - IP rate limiting
   - Loss of access to Minecraft services

3. **Rate Limiting**: Our tool is designed to respect Mojang's rate limits (60 requests/minute) to minimize impact on their services and reduce your risk of penalties.

4. **Community Impact**: Aggressive sniping can create artificial scarcity and potentially prevent legitimate users from obtaining usernames through normal means.

We've designed this tool primarily for educational purposes and personal use. It includes safeguards to respect rate limits and reduce potential negative impacts.

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **"Python is not recognized" error**:
   - Make sure you checked "Add Python to PATH" during installation
   - Restart your computer and try again
   - Try using `python3` instead of `python`

2. **Setup fails with dependency errors**:
   - Run this command manually: `pip install requests colorama python-dotenv urllib3 beautifulsoup4`
   - Make sure your internet connection is working

3. **Authentication issues**:
   - Make sure you're using a valid Microsoft account with Minecraft ownership
   - Clear the `auth_cache.json` file and try again
   - Check your internet connection

4. **"No module named..." errors**:
   - Re-run the setup script: `python setup.py`
   - Try manually installing the missing module: `pip install module_name`

5. **Rate limiting issues**:
   - The Mojang API has strict rate limits
   - Decrease check frequency to avoid rate limits
   - Consider using proxies for advanced usage

## üìû Need More Help?

If you encounter issues not covered in this guide:

1. Check for errors in the console output
2. Make sure you're using the latest version of this tool
3. Verify your Python installation is working correctly
4. Try running the tool with the `-v` flag for verbose output:
   ```bash
   python easy_sniper.py -v
   ```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

This tool uses Microsoft's official OAuth flow. Your credentials are never stored in plain text. When you authenticate:

1. A browser window will open for you to log in directly on Microsoft's website
2. After login, Microsoft provides a secure token to the tool
3. This token is stored locally in `auth_cache.json`

If you prefer not to use browser authentication, you can create a `.env` file with your credentials, but this is less secure.

## üî• Pro Tips for Maximum Success

1. **Research usernames before they drop**: Use the tool to check when names will become available.
2. **Test your connection**: Run the latency test before attempting to snipe.
3. **Use the right strategy**:
   - For low-competition names: Timing Strategy is often sufficient
   - For high-competition names: Distributed or Adaptive Strategies work best
4. **Prepare your account**: Make sure your account is eligible for a name change before the name drops.
5. **Use a stable internet connection**: Wired connections are more reliable than Wi-Fi.
