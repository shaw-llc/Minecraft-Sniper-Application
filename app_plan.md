# Minecraft Username Sniper App Conversion Plan

## Overview
Convert the existing Python-based Minecraft Username Sniper into a cross-platform desktop application with a modern GUI.

## Technologies
1. **Frontend Framework**: Electron.js (for cross-platform desktop app)
2. **UI Framework**: React with Material UI for a modern interface
3. **Backend**: Node.js with the existing Python scripts as the core engine
4. **Packaging**: Electron Forge for creating installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux
